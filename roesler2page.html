                  <p style="text-align:center">Dolly is a Yorkie Bichon Mix. She was my family's
                  dog for 16 years. She loved belly rubs, long walks, and laying in the sun!</p>
                

                  
                    <p style="text-align:center">In my free time I love to watch and play 
                    basketball. With my grandparents graduating from the University of Kentucky,
                    I have become a diehard fan over the years.
