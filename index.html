            <p> My Name is Colin Roesler and I am currently a Junior at University of Nebraska-Omaha 
            and will be graduating December 2025. I have lived in Papillion my whole life,
            a suburb of Omaha.
            I am studying Management Information Systems with a minor in Computer Science.
            Throughout my time here, I have gotten great experience with programming languages 
            like Python, HTML, and CSS. Also, I have become comfortable with database management
            while using SQL in Oracle Data Modeler. My goal is to accept an internship this summer
            to help get an idea if database administration is the right fit for me or 
            if I would prefer a career in software development.

            <p>
            Completing this assignment gave me a great review of HTML and CSS. These skills
            are crucial for future Web Application Development projects.
